        <h1>Life Story of Fives</h1>

        <p>
            Fives’ story begins as a clone cadet named CT-5555 in Domino Squad, who distinguished himself by ultimately graduating with his squadmate Echo after a difficult training period. He became an Advanced Recon Commando (ARC) trooper after the Republic outpost on the Rishi Moon was attacked and he and Echo were the sole survivors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fives’ career was marked by a discovery about the inhibitor chips implanted in all clones, which he realized were part of a plot by Chancellor Palpatine to turn the clones against the Jedi. While trying to expose the conspiracy, he was shot and killed by Commander Fox on Coruscant after being framed as an assassin.
